# Calico ðŸ¤–

**Calico** is a miniature relocatable wearable system with fast and precise locomotion for on-body interaction, actuation and sensing. 
Calico consists of a two-wheel robot and an on-cloth track mechanism or "railway," on which the robot travels. 
The robot is self-contained, small in size, and has additional sensor expansion options. 

For more detailed information, please refer to the [paper website](https://smartlab.cs.umd.edu/publication/calico).

## Arduino Configuration
The robot is powered by an ESP32 S3-Zero, which is programmed using the Arduino IDE. 
Please refer to the below steps to set up the Arduino IDE for Calico.
- Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Add ESP32 board support by going to `File` > `Preferences` and adding the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:
  ```
  https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
  ```
- Open the Boards Manager from `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`, search for "ESP32," and install the latest version of the ESP32 board package.
- Select the ESP32 S3-Zero board from `Tools` > `Board` > `ESP32 S3 Dev Module`.
- Refer to the below image to configure the ESP32 settings:

## Connect & control the robot
To connect and control the robot, follow these steps:
1. **Connect the robot to your computer** using a USB-C cable.
2. **Open the Arduino IDE** and select the correct port from `Tools` > `Port`.
3. **Change the WiFi credentials** in the `main_app.ino' file (line 46 - 49) to match your network:
   ```
   const char* ssid_dev = "your-ssid";
   const char* password_dev = "your-password";
   const char* ssid = "your-ssid";
   const char* password = "your-password";
   ```
4. **Upload the code** to the ESP32 S3-Zero by clicking the upload button in the Arduino IDE.
5. Once the upload is complete, open the Serial Monitor from `Tools` > `Serial Monitor` to see the connection status.
6. If the robot connects successfully, you will see a message indicating the IP address assigned to the robot.
7. **Open the GUI** by navigating to the IP address in your web browser. The GUI will allow you to control the robot's movement and LED strip.
