# Calico ðŸ¤–

**Calico** is a miniature relocatable wearable system with fast and precise locomotion for on-body interaction, actuation and sensing. 
Calico consists of a two-wheel robot and an on-cloth track mechanism or "railway," on which the robot travels. 
The robot is self-contained, small in size, and has additional sensor expansion options. 

For more detailed information, please refer to the [paper website](https://smartlab.cs.umd.edu/publication/calico).

## Arduino Configuration
The robot is powered by an ESP32 S3-Zero, which is programmed using the Arduino IDE. 
Please refer to the below steps to set up the Arduino IDE for Calico.
- Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Add ESP32 board support by going to `File` > `Preferences` and adding the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:
  ```
  https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
  ```
- Open the Boards Manager from `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`, search for "ESP32," and install the latest version of the ESP32 board package.
- Select the ESP32 S3-Zero board from `Tools` > `Board` > `ESP32 S3 Dev Module`.
- Refer to the below image to configure the ESP32 settings:
