# Calico ðŸ¤–

**Calico** is a miniature relocatable wearable system with fast and precise locomotion for on-body interaction, actuation and sensing. 
Calico consists of a two-wheel robot and an on-cloth track mechanism or "railway," on which the robot travels. 
The robot is self-contained, small in size, and has additional sensor expansion options.
